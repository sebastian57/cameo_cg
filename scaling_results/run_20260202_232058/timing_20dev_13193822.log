2026-02-02 23:31:42.697793: E external/xla/xla/pjrt/distributed/client.cc:137] Failed to connect to distributed JAX controller: waited too long for some tasks to show up. This may be due to 1) some tasks crashed earlier before connecting, 2) some tasks were never scheduled, or 3) scheduling delays. Consider setting a longer initialization timeout if such delays are expected, the timeout is currently set to: 5m.

Original runtime error: DEADLINE_EXCEEDED: Barrier timed out. Id: PjRT_Client_Connect. This usually happens because a task triggered the barrier too early or too slowly. Please look at the task logs (both timed out and first task) to debug further.
# of tasks that reached the barrier: 4/5.
